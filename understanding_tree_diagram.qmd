:::{.cr-section}

A tree diagram is a tool used in mathematics, probability, and statistics to calculate the number of possible outcomes of an event or problem and to systematically list those potential outcomes. @cr-layout1

In data visualization, this technique is also used to visualize hierarchical relationships within data.

They can also be referred to as `organizational charts` or `linkage trees`.

Tree diagrams can have different layouts, such as `radial`, `vertical`, or `horizontal`, but the underlying concept remains the same.

**Radial layout** @cr-layout1

:::{#cr-layout1}
![](img/tree_radial.jpg){width=100%}
:::

**Horizontal layout** @cr-layout2

:::{#cr-layout2}
![](img/tree_hor_1.jpg){width=100%}
:::

**Vertical layout** @cr-layout3

:::{#cr-layout3}
![](img/tree_vert_3.jpg){width=100%}
:::

:::{focus-on="cr-tree-rad" .scale-to-fill}
Now, let's examine the structure in more detail.
:::

:::{focus-on="cr-tree-rad"}
Tree diagrams comprise two major components:

1. Nodes
2. Branches
:::
:::{focus-on="cr-tree-rad"}

### **Nodes:**
---

Nodes represent the different elements or entities within a hierarchy. Each node typically signifies a decision, category, or outcome, depending on the context. In this chart, each node is represented by a point marker. [@cr-tree-rad]{scale-by="2" pan-to="75%,-50%"}

:::

:::{focus-on="cr-tree-rad"}
1. **Root Node**: Root nodes are the topmost elements and have no parent.


2. **Internal Nodes**: Internal nodes represent intermediary elements that have both parent and child nodes.

3. **Leaf Nodes (End Nodes)**: Leaf nodes are the endpoints, representing the final or terminal elements in the hierarchy.

:::

Tree diagrams are very useful in various fields, such as organizational management, decision analysis, and data classification, as they clearly depict the structure and relationships within a system.

And, of course, they are also used in many creative and visually appealing ways to achieve these purposes. Now, let's look at a few examples!

Like this one by Andreea Scintei [Andreea Scintei](#)[^1], where it was used to visualize the relationships in *The Expanse* [@cr-the-expanse]{scale-by="1.3" pan-to="-25%,0%"}.

And check this one out, also by [Tristan Guillevin](#), the mastermind behind one of the most intuitive tree diagram generators[^2] you'll find anywhere on the internet (and did I mention it's free? ðŸ˜‰). @cr-tree-radial2

Okay, the last one (I promise ðŸ˜‚): Here is another tree diagram by [Patrick Sarsfield](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/patrick.sarsfield/vizzes) [^2] @cr-tree-radial3
